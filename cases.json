Embolization for cure is unlikely to be effective given small distal vessels supplying. Little role for preop partial embo. Radiosurgery an option. Difficult to target. Latency period risk. Surgery likely best approach. Surgical approach is best prone, suboccipital craniotomy. Avm will be found by picking up the PICA and following the artery through the prepyramidal/suboccipital fissure (fissure above the pyramid).",
